HyperClick 2.0 - Breaking Changes
=================================

HyperClick has been rebuilt to be both simpler and more flexible:
- All file resolvers were consolidated into one.
- Language support is now managed via selectors, making it
  easier to add languages and seamless to support alternative
  packages for any language.
- Settings were restructured to be easier to extend and modify.

This means you might need to update your (project-) settings.
Please read this explainer to help you do so:
